[objectives] we investigate the use of requirements templates for the systematic elicitation of legal requirements. our work is motivated by two observations: (1) the existing literature does not provide a harmonized view on the requirements templates that are useful for legal re; (2) despite the promising recent advancements in natural language processing (nlp), automated support for legal re through the suggestion of requirements templates has not been achieved yet. our objective is to take steps toward addressing these limitations. [methods] we review and reconcile the legal requirement templates proposed in re. subsequently, we conduct a qualitative study to define nlp rules for template recommendation. [results and conclusions] our contributions consist of (a) a harmonized list of requirements templates pertinent to legal re, and (b) rules for the automatic recommendation of such templates. we evaluate our rules through a case study on 400 statements from two legal domains. the results indicate a recall and precision of 82,3% and 79,8%, respectively. we show that introducing some limited interaction with the analyst considerably improves accuracy. specifically, our human-feedback strategy increases recall by 12% and precision by 10,8%, thus yielding an overall recall of 94,3% and overall precision of 90,6%."

            "abstract": "requirements are usually written by different stakeholders with diverse backgrounds and skills and evolve continuously. therefore inconsistency caused by specialized jargons and different domains, is inevitable. in particular, entity coreference in requirement engineering (re) is that different linguistic expressions refer to the same real-world entity. it leads to misconception about technical terminologies, and impacts the readability and understandability of requirements negatively. manual detection entity coreference is labor-intensive and time-consuming. in this paper, we propose a deep context-wise semantic method named deepcoref to entity coreference detection. it consists of one fine-tuning bert model for context representation and a word2vec-based network for entity representation. we use a multi-layer perception in the end to fuse and make a trade-off between two representations for obtaining a better representation of entities. the input of the network is requirement contextual text and related entities, and the output is the predictive label to infer whether two entities are coreferent. the evaluation on industry data shows that our approach significantly outperforms three baselines with average precision and recall of 96.10% and 96.06% respectively. we also compare deepcoref with three variants to demonstrate the performance enhancement from different components."

            "abstract": "accurate inference of molecular and functional interactions among genes, especially in multicellular organisms such as drosophila, often requires statistical analysis of correlations not only between the magnitudes of gene expressions, but also between their temporal-spatial patterns. the ish (in-situ-hybridization)-based gene expression micro-imaging technology offers an effective approach to perform large-scale spatial-temporal profiling of whole-body mrna abundance. however, analytical tools for discovering gene interactions from such data remain an open challenge due to various reasons, including difficulties in extracting canonical representations of gene activities from images, and in inference of statistically meaningful networks from such representations. in this paper, we present gini, a machine learning system for inferring gene interaction networks from drosophila embryonic ish images. gini builds on a computer-vision-inspired vector-space representation of the spatial pattern of gene expression in ish images, enabled by our recently developed system; and a new multi-instance-kernel algorithm that learns a sparse markov network model, in which, every gene (i.e., node) in the network is represented by a vector-valued spatial pattern rather than a scalar-valued gene intensity as in conventional approaches such as a gaussian graphical model. by capturing the notion of spatial similarity of gene expression, and at the same time properly taking into account the presence of multiple images per gene via multi-instance kernels, gini is well-positioned to infer statistically sound, and biologically meaningful gene interaction networks from image data. using both synthetic data and a small manually curated data set, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in network building. furthermore, we report results on a large publicly available collection of drosophila embryonic ish images from the berkeley drosophila genome project, where gini makes novel and interesting predictions of gene interactions. software for gini is available at http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/drosophila_ish_images/"

(chourabi et al., 2012) smart city involvements are the end results of, and uncomfortably incorporated into, present social and spatial configurations of urban governa nce (br a tu, 2015) a nd the built setting: the s ma rt city is put together gradually, integrated awkwardly into current arrangements of city administration and the reinforced environment. smart cities are intrinsically distinguished, being geographically asymmetrical at a diversity of scales. not all places of the city will be similarly smart: smart cities will favor some spaces, individuals, and undertakings over others. an essential component of the smart city is its capacity to further economic growth. (shelton et al., 2015)2. the assemblage of participants, tenets and technologies related to smart city interventionsthe \"smart city\" notion has arisen from long-persisting opinions regarding urban technological idealistic schemes (lazaroiu, 2013) and the absolutely competitive city. smart cities are where novel technologies may be produced and the receptacles for technology, i.e. the goal of its utilizations. the contest to join this movement and become a smart city has stimulated city policymakers to endogenize the performance of technology-led growth (lazaroiu, 2014a, b, c), leading municipal budgets toward financings that present smart city standing. the boundaries of the smart city are generated both by the lack of data utilizations that can handle shared and not separate solutions and by the incapacity to aim at indefinit e features of cities that both enhance and blemish from the standard of urban existence for city inhabitants. smart city technology fina ncings are chiefly composed of a meliorations inst ea d of genuine innovations, on the cit izen consumer side. (glasmeier and christopherson, 2015) the notion of smart city as a method to improve the life standard of individuals has been achieving rising relevance in the calendars of policymakers. the amount of \"smart\" proposals initiated by a municipality can lead to an intermediate final product that indicates the endeavors made to augment the quality of existence of the citizens. the probabilities of a city raising its degree of smartness are contingent on several country-specific variables that outweigh its economic, technological and green advancement rate. public administrations dema nd backing to organize the notion of the smartness of a city (nica, 2015a, b, c, d), to encapsulate its ramifications, to establish standards at the global level, and to observe enhancement chances. (neir otti et a l., 2014) t he gr owth of smart cit ies is assisting the rise of government employment of itcs to enhance political involvement, enforce public schemes or supply public spher e ser vices. ther e is no one wa y to becoming smart, and diverse cities ha ve embraced distinct adva nces that indicate their specific circumstances. the administration of smart cities is dependent on elaborate arrangements of interdependent entities. (rodriguez bolivar, 2015)the association of smart (technology-enabled) solutions to satisfy the leading societal difficult tasks and the concentration on the city as the chief determinant of alteration bring about the notion of the \"smart city.\" the rise of novel technologies to assess and interlink various facets of ordinary exis- tence (\"the internet of things\") is relevant in the progression towards a smart city. the latter is attempt ing to encourage a nd adjust innovations to the demands of their citizens (pera, 2015a, b) by urging synergetic advancement of inventions with various stakeholders. \u2026"

            "abstract": "software-enabled technologies and urban big data have become essential to the functioning of cities. consequently, urban operational governance and city services are becoming highly responsive to a form of data-driven urbanism that is the key mode of production for smart cities. at the heart of data-driven urbanism is a computational understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logic and calculative rules and procedures, which is underpinned by an instrumental rationality and realist epistemology. this rationality and epistemology are informed by and sustains urban science and urban informatics, which seek to make cities more knowable and controllable. this paper examines the forms, practices and ethics of smart cities and urban science, paying particular attention to: instrumental rationality and realist epistemology; privacy, datafication, dataveillance and geosurveillance; and data uses, such as social sorting and anticipatory governance. it argues that smart city initiatives and urban science need to be re-cast in three ways: a re-orientation in how cities are conceived; a reconfiguring of the underlying epistemology to openly recognize the contingent and relational nature of urban systems, processes and science; and the adoption of ethical principles designed to realize benefits of smart cities and urban science while reducing pernicious effects. this article is part of the themed issue \u2018the ethical impact of data science\u2019."

(1-3) accurate and noninvasive monitoring of temperature changes in individual cells could thus help clarify intricate cellular processes and develop new applications in biology and medicine. here we report the use of green fluorescent proteins (gfp) as thermal nanoprobes suited for intracellular temperature mapping. temperature probing is achieved by monitoring the fluorescence polarization anisotropy of gfp. the method is tested on gfp-transfected hela and u-87 mg cancer cell lines where we monitored the heat delivery by photothermal heating of gold nanorods surrounding the cells. a spatial resolution of 300 nm and a temperature accuracy of about 0.4 \u00b0c are achieved. benefiting from its full compatibility with widely used gfp-transfected cells, this approach provides a noninvasive tool for fundamental and applied research in areas ranging from molecular biology to therapeutic and diagnostic studies."

(2) due to the above-mentioned characteristics of spatial planning problems, we suggest using techniques of requirements engineering (re) and crowdre for getting stakeholders (e.g. user groups) involved. (3) we propose video as a medium for communicating problems, solution alternatives, and arguments effectively within a mixed crowd of officials, citizens, children and elderly people.although few spatial planning problems can be solved by software alone, this new perspective helps to focus discussions anyway. re techniques can assist in finding common ground despite the heterogeneous group of stakeholders, e.g. citizens. digital requirements and video are well-suited for facilitating distribution, feedback, and discourse via the internet. in this paper, we propose this new perspective as a timely opportunity for the spatial planning domain \u2013 and as an increasingly important application domain of crowdre."

            "abstract": "achieving and maintaining high standards of animal welfare is critical to the success of a modern zoo. research has shown that an animal\u2019s welfare is highly dependent on how various individual animal factors (e.g., species traits, genetics, temperament and previous experience) interact with environmental features (e.g., social grouping, enclosure design and sensory environment). one prominent feature of the zoo environment is the presence of visitors. visitor contact can be unpredictable and intense, particularly in terms of auditory and visual interaction. depending on an animal\u2019s perception of this interaction, visitors can have either negative, neutral or positive impacts on zoo animal behaviour and welfare. this paper reviews the literature on the implications and potential opportunities of human-zoo animal interactions on animal behaviour and welfare, with the aim of stimulating interest, understanding and exploration of this important subject. the literature to date presents a mixed range of findings on the topic. it is possible this variation in the responses of zoo animals to visitors may be due to species-specific differences, the nature and intensity of the visitor interactions, enclosure design, and individual animal characteristics. analysing these studies and better understanding animal preferences and motivations can provide insight into what animals find negatively and positively reinforcing in terms of visitor contact in a specific zoo setting. this understanding can then be applied to either safeguard welfare in cases where visitors can have a negative impact, or, conversely, it can be applied to highlight opportunities to encourage animal-visitor interaction in situations where animals experience positive emotions associated with visitor interaction."

            "abstract": "introduction happiness and social inclusion are important indicators of social sustainability, as recommended in the sustainable development goals; however, little is known about the social sustainable development of ethnic minorities. to fill this knowledge gap, special attention is paid to understanding the issues of social exclusion and happiness in relation to the indigenous peoples in taiwan. methods data used were drawn from a nationwide representativeness survey of the taiwanese indigenous people in 2007; it included 2,200 respondents. this study employed binary logistic regression to examine the effects of different domains of social exclusion on the likelihood of perceiving happiness; other exogenous factors, were controlled. results the results show that among the respondents, mountain indigenous peoples, females, the elderly and those who are healthier, wealthier, highly educated, possessing western beliefs, and are more likely to be happy, compared to their counterparts. as expected, the results reveal that the likelihood of being happy is higher for those who have received medical benefits, as well as those persons without housing problems or financial difficulties, compared to their excluded counterparts. however, no significant association is found between happiness and some social exclusion domains, such as child and youth benefits, and unemployment benefits. conclusions the disengagement of the indigenous peoples in mainstream society, with respect to the accessibility of welfare provisions, is a crucial element in regard to social exclusion and happiness. several policy implications for the social sustainability of indigenous peoples can be inferred from these findings. for example, providing a mobile clinical tour, on-site health counseling, or homecare service can contribute to the removal of institutional and geographic barriers to medical welfare provisions for the mountain indigenes. moreover, the government may devote more welfare resources to assist indigenous families and tribal communities to develop their own social safety net, instead of the individual-oriented welfare provisions."

(2005a). further conformation of the identity of image\u2010derived spectra was confirmed by matching these spectra with laboratory\u2010measured spectra of samples collected from haughton. the results from the \u201cblind\u201d remote sensing methods used here suggest that these techniques can also be used to understand subsurface lithologies on mars, where ground truth knowledge may not be generally available.\""

            "abstract": "abstract \\n as analysts still grapple with understanding core damage accident progression at three mile island and fukushima that caught the nuclear industry off-guard once too many times, one notices the very limited detail with which the large reactor cores of these subject reactors have been modelled in their severe accident simulation code packages. at the same time, modelling of candu severe accidents have largely borrowed from and suffered from the limitations of the same lwr codes (see iaea tecdoc 1727) whose applications to phwrs have poorly caught critical phwr design specifics and vulnerabilities. as a result, accident management measures that have been instituted at candu phwrs, while meeting the important industry objective of publically seeming to be doing something about lessons learnt from say fukushima and showing that the reactor designs are oh so close to perfect and the off-site consequences of severe accidents happily benign. \\n integrated phwr severe accident progression and consequence assessment code roshni can make a significant contribution to actual, practical understanding of severe accident progression in candu phwrs, improving significantly on the other phwr specific computer codes developed three decades ago when modeling decisions were constrained by limited computing power and poor understanding of and interest in severe core damage accidents. these codes force gross simplifications in reactor core modelling and do not adequately represent all the right candu core details, materials, fluids, vessels or phenomena. but they produce results that are familiar and palatable. they do, however to their credit, also excel in their computational speed, largely because they model and compute so little and with such un-necessary simplifications. \\n roshni sheds most previous modelling simplifications and represents each of the 380 channels, 4560 bundle, 37 elements in four concentric ring, zircaloy clad fuel geometry, materials and fluids more faithfully in a 2000 mw(th) candu6 reactor. it can be used easily for other phwrs with different number of fuel channels and bundles per each channel. each of horizontal phwr reactor channels with all their bundles, fuel rings, sheaths, appendages, end fittings and feeders are modelled and in detail that reflects large across core differences. while other codes model at best a few hundred core fuel entities, thermo-chemical transient behaviour of about 73,000 different fuel channel entities within the core is considered by roshni simultaneously along with other 15,000 or so other flow path segments. at each location all known thermo-chemical and hydraulic phenomena are computed. with such detail, roshni is able to provide information on their progressive and parallel thermo-chemical contribution to accident progression and a more realistic fission product release source term that would belie the miniscule one (100 tbq of cs-137 or 0.15% of core inventory) used by emos now in canada on recommendation of our national regulator cnsc. roshni has an advanced, more candu specific consideration of each bundle transitioning to a solid debris behaviour in the calandria vessel without reverting to a simplified molten corium formulation that happily ignores interaction of debris with vessel welds, further vessel failures and energetic interactions. the code is able to follow behaviour of each fuel bundle following its disassembly from the fuel channel and thus demonstrate that the gross assumption of a core collapse made in some analyses is wrong and misleading. it is able to thus demonstrate that phwr core disassembly is not only gradual, it will be also be incomplete with a large number of low power, peripheral fuel channels never disassembling under most credible scenarios. \\n the code is designed to grow into and use its voluminous results in a severe accident simulator for operator training. it\u2019s phenomenological models are able to examine design inadequacies / issues that affect accident progression and several simple to implement design improvements that have a profound effect on results. for example, an early pressure boundary failure due to inadequacy of heat sinks in a station blackout scenario can be examined along with the effect of improved and adequate over pressure protection. \\n a best effort code such as roshni can be instrumental in identifying the risk reduction benefits of undertaking certain design, operational and accidental management improvements for phwrs, with some of the multi-unit ones handicapped by poor pressurizer placement and leaky containments with vulnerable materials, poor overpressure protection, ad-hoc mitigation measures and limited instrumentation common to all candus. case in point is the psa supported design and installed number of hydrogen recombiners that are neither for the right gas (designed mysteriously for h2 instead of d2) or its potential release quantity (they are sparse and will cause explosions). \\n the paper presents roshni results of simulations of a postulated station blackout scenario and sheds a light on the challenges ahead in minimizing risk from operation of these otherwise unique power reactors."

            "abstract": "the ability to promptly recognise new research trends is strategic for many stakeholders, including universities, institutional funding bodies, academic publishers and companies. while the literature describes several approaches which aim to identify the emergence of new research topics early in their lifecycle, these rely on the assumption that the topic in question is already associated with a number of publications and consistently referred to by a community of researchers. hence, detecting the emergence of a new research area at an embryonic stage , i.e., before the topic has been consistently labelled by a community of researchers and associated with a number of publications, is still an open challenge. in this paper, we begin to address this challenge by performing a study of the dynamics preceding the creation of new topics. this study indicates that the emergence of a new topic is anticipated by a significant increase in the pace of collaboration between relevant research areas, which can be seen as the \u2018parents\u2019 of the new topic. these initial findings (i) confirm our hypothesis that it is possible in principle to detect the emergence of a new topic at the embryonic stage, (ii) provide new empirical evidence supporting relevant theories in philosophy of science, and also (iii) suggest that new topics tend to emerge in an environment in which weakly interconnected research areas begin to cross-fertilise."

(san diego, n = 690; portland, n = 634; nashville, n = 664) was conducted. all participants were asked about getting to know people within their neighborhood. pet owners were asked additional questions about the type/s of pet/s they owned, whether they had formed friendships as a result of their pet, and if they had received any of four different types of social support from the people they met through their pet. results pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners (or 1.61; 95%ci: 1.30, 1.99). when analyzed by site, this relationship was significant for perth, san diego and nashville. among pet owners, dog owners in the three u.s. cities (but not perth) were significantly more likely than owners of other types of pets to regard people whom they met through their pet as a friend (or 2.59; 95%ci: 1.94, 3.46). around 40% of pet owners reported receiving one or more types of social support (i.e. emotional, informational, appraisal, instrumental) via people they met through their pet. conclusion this research suggests companion animals can be a catalyst for several dimensions of human social relationships in neighborhood settings, ranging from incidental social interaction and getting to know people, through to formation of new friendships. for many pet owners, their pets also facilitated relationships from which they derived tangible forms of social support, both of a practical and emotionally supportive nature. given growing evidence for social isolation as a risk factor for mental health, and, conversely, friendships and social support as protective factors for individual and community well-being, pets may be an important factor in developing healthy neighborhoods."

irma. introduction syndromic surveillance is the monitoring of symptom combinations (i.e., syndromes) or other indicators within a population to inform public health actions. the tennessee department of health (tdh) collects emergency department (ed) data from more than 70 hospitals across tennessee to support statewide syndromic surveillance activities. hospitals in tennessee typically provide data within 48 hours of a patient encounter. while syndromic surveillance often supplements disease- or condition-specific surveillance, it can also provide general situational awareness about emergency department patients during an event or response. during hurricanes harvey (continental us landfall on august 25, 2017) and irma (continental us landfall on september 10, 2017), tdh supported all hazards situational awareness using the electronic surveillance system for the early notification of community-based epidemics (essence) in the biosense platform supported by the national syndromic surveillance program (nssp). the volume of out-of-state patients in tennessee was monitored to assess the impact on the healthcare system and any geographic- or hospital-specific clustering of out-of-state patients within tennessee. results were included in daily state health operations center (shoc) situation reports and shared with agency response partners such as the tennessee emergency management agency (tema). methods data were monitored from august 18, 2017 through september 24, 2017. a simple query was established in essence using the patient location (full details) dataset. data were limited to hospital ed visits reported by tennessee (site = \u201ctennessee\u201d). to monitor ed visits among residents of texas before, during, and after major hurricane harvey, data were queried for a patient zip code within texas (state = \u201ctexas\u201d). ed visits among florida residents were monitored similarly (state = \u201cflorida\u201d) before, during, and after major hurricane irma. additionally, a free text chief complaint search was implemented for the terms \u201charvey\u201d, \u201cirma, \u201churricane\u201d, \u201cevacuee\u201d, \u201cevacuate\u201d, \u201cflorida\u201d, and \u201ctexas\u201d. chief complaint search results were then filtered to remove encounters with patient zip codes within tennessee. results from august 18, 2017 through september 24, 2017, tennessee hospital eds reported 277 patient encounters among texas residents and 1,041 patient encounters among florida residents. the number of encounters among patients from texas remained stable throughout the monitoring period. in contrast, the number of encounters among patients from florida exceeded the expected value on september 7, peaked september 10 at 116 patient encounters, and returned to expected levels on september 16 (figure 1). the increase in patients from florida was evenly distributed across most of tennessee, with some clustering around a popular tourism area in east tennessee. no concerning trends in reported syndromes or chief complaints were identified among texas or florida patients. the free text chief complaint query first exceeded the expected value on september 9, peaked on september 11 with 5 patient encounters, and returned to expected levels on september 14. from august 18 through september 24, 21 of 30 visits captured by the query were among florida residents. one tennessee hospital appeared to be intentionally using the term \u201cirma\u201d in their chief complaint field to indicate patients from florida impacted by the hurricane. conclusions the essence instance in the biosense platform provided tdh the opportunity to easily locate and monitor out-of-state patients seen in tennessee hospital eds. while tdh was unable to validate whether all patients identified as residents of florida were displaced because of major hurricane irma, the timing of the rise and fall of patient encounters was highly suggestive. likewise, seeing no substantial increase ed patients with residence in texas reassured tdh that the effects of hurricane harvey were not impacting hospital emergency departments in tennessee. tdh used information and charts from essence to support situational awareness in our shoc and at tema. use of patient zip code to identify out-of-state residents was more sensitive than chief complaint searches by keyword during this event. essence allowed tdh to see where out-of-state patients appeared to be concentrating in tennessee and monitor the need for targeting messaging and resources to heavily affected areas. additionally, close surveillance of chief complaints among out-of-state patients provided assurance that no unusual patterns in illness or injury were occurring. essence is the only tdh information source capable of rapidly collecting health information on out-of-state patients. essence allowed tdh to quickly identify a change within the patient population seen at tennessee emergency departments and monitor the situation until the patient population returned to baseline levels."

            "abstract": "\\n purpose \\n research data publishing is today widely regarded as crucial for reproducibility, proper assessment of scientific results, and as a way for researchers to get proper credit for sharing their data. however, several challenges need to be solved to fully realize its potential, one of them being the development of a global standard for links between research data and literature. current linking solutions are mostly based on bilateral, ad hoc agreements between publishers and data centers. these operate in silos so that content cannot be readily combined to deliver a network graph connecting research data and literature in a comprehensive and reliable way. the research data alliance (rda) publishing data services working group (pds-wg) aims to address this issue of fragmentation by bringing together different stakeholders to agree on a common infrastructure for sharing links between datasets and literature. the paper aims to discuss these issues. \\n \\n \\n design/methodology/approach \\n this paper presents the synergic effort of the rda pds-wg and the openaire infrastructure toward enabling a common infrastructure for exchanging data-literature links by realizing and operating the data-literature interlinking (dli) service. the dli service populates and provides access to a graph of data set-literature links (at the time of writing close to five million, and growing) collected from a variety of major data centers, publishers, and research organizations. \\n \\n \\n findings \\n to achieve its objectives, the service proposes an interoperable exchange data model and format, based on which it collects and publishes links, thereby offering the opportunity to validate such common approach on real-case scenarios, with real providers and consumers. feedback of these actors will drive continuous refinement of the both data model and exchange format, supporting the further development of the service to become an essential part of a universal, open, cross-platform, cross-discipline solution for collecting, and sharing data set-literature links. \\n \\n \\n originality/value \\n this realization of the dli service is the first technical, cross-community, and collaborative effort in the direction of establishing a common infrastructure for facilitating the exchange of data set-literature links. as a result of its operation and underlying community effort, a new activity, name scholix, has been initiated involving the technological level stakeholders such as datacite and crossref. \\n"

(2) the use of bodily empathy with records can respectfully bring together the understanding of costume in performance as inseparable from the performer\u2019s body with dance as an art form that explicitly uses the dancing costume-body as an expressive tool. it is argued that bodily empathy with records in the dance archive helps one access bodily holisms that create possibilities for exploring the potential of art to critically expose and render strange ideological systems and normativities."
